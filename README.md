## Known limitations/Bugs

- Sync from Notion sometimes doesn't register when the page was recently updated by GCal
  - Caused by lack of precision in Notion's last edited timestamp
- Will only check 100 most recently edited pages in database (Caused by Notion API limit)
- Rich text (bolding, italics, etc.) used in the description will be overwritten to plain text after syncing.
- Doesn't work with auto-generated calendars such as Birthdays. Might be a limitation of GCal API.
- Descriptions can only have MAX 2,000 characters. This is a limit imposed by Notion.
