# Yet Another Two-Way Notion-Google Calendar Sync Script 

Yet another script to synchronize events between Google Calendar and a Notion database.

This script aims to be a simple to setup, set and forget method of achieving two-way synchronization between a Notion Database, and multiple personal Google Calendars. By using Google App Scripts, this project avoids the mess caused by potential differences in operating systems, needing to download and install extra programs, and needing a personal computer that is currently turned on. It also means access to special integration benefits such as triggers actioned by an update to a Google Calendar event.

Currently supports two-way event creation, deletion, and updating.

## Known limitations/Bugs

- Sync from Notion sometimes doesn't register when the page was recently updated by GCal
  - Caused by lack of precision in Notion's last edited timestamp
- Will only check 100 most recently edited pages in database
  - Caused by Notion API limit
- Rich text (bolding, italics, etc.) used in the description will be overwritten to plain text after syncing.
- Doesn't seem to work with auto-generated calendars such as Birthdays. Might be a limitation of GCal API. See https://github.com/hk21702/YA-GCal-Notion-Sync-Script/issues/3
- Descriptions can only have at most 2,000 characters. This is a limit imposed by Notion. The script will fail gracefully if the event is being newly created, but will fail catastrophically if it is trying to update an event. This is intentional to prevent data merge issues.
